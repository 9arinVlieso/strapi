# How to Use HD Online Player to Solve Differential Equations
  
Differential equations are mathematical expressions that relate a function and its derivatives. They are often used to model physical phenomena, such as heat transfer, fluid dynamics, or population growth. Solving differential equations can be challenging, especially when they involve complex or nonlinear terms.
